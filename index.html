			<h2 id="h2_1">Spirit</h2>
			<p>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood, garnish'd and deck'd in modest compliment, not working with the eye without the ear, and but in purged judgement trusting neither? Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.</p>

			<h2 id="h2_2">Soul</h2>
			<p>A wretched soul, bruised with adversity, We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;  But were we burdened with like weight of pain, As much or more we should ourselves complain.</p>

			<h2 id="h2_3">Reflection</h2>
			<p>And since you know you cannot see yourself, so well as by reflection, I, your glass, will modestly discover to yourself, that of yourself which you yet know not of.</p>
